## Child-Friendly Night Light (Ages 1-5)

### Key Features

- **Research-Backed Defaults**: Based on peer-reviewed studies of children's light sensitivity
- **Ultra-Low Brightness** (1-5%): Minimizes melatonin suppression in highly sensitive young children
- **Warm Amber Color** (2000K): Studies show minimal circadian impact even at higher intensities
- **3 Configurable Time Slots**: Nighttime + 2 optional nap periods (each can be enabled/disabled)
- **Motion-Activated Brightness Boost**: Temporarily increases brightness for parent checks, then returns to base
- **Smooth Transitions**: Gentle changes prevent startling sleeping children
- **Age-Specific Recommendations**: Detailed guidance for ages 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, and 4-5
- **Wide Compatibility**: Works with RGB lights (Third Reality, LIFX) and tunable white lights (Philips Hue, IKEA TRADFRI)

### Scientific Research Summary

This blueprint implements findings from multiple peer-reviewed studies:

**Key Research Finding**: Preschool-aged children experience 87.6% melatonin suppression from bright light and 77.5% suppression even from very dim light (5-40 lux). Melatonin remains suppressed for 50+ minutes after exposure ends.

- **Children are FAR more sensitive than adults**: Blue-enriched light (6200K) significantly suppresses melatonin in children but not adults
- **Amber/red light is safe**: Even 800 lux of amber light has minimal impact on melatonin production
- **Recommended maximum**: 1.5 lux for children's sleep environments
- **Blueprint default**: 3% brightness (~1-2 lux) with 2000K warm amber color

*Full research citations in the detailed documentation*

### Quick Start - Child Night Light

**Import URL:**
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leviemartin/HomeAssistant-Repo/main/blueprints/child_night_light.yaml
```

1. Import blueprint (Settings → Automations & Scenes → Blueprints → Import Blueprint)
2. Create automation and configure:
   - **Night Lights**: Select 1-4 lights (must support color temperature)
   - **Nighttime Schedule**: Set bedtime and wake-up time
   - **Use default settings**: Already optimized based on research (3% brightness, 2000K)
   - **Optional**: Add motion sensor for automatic brightness boost during nighttime checks
3. Done! Research-backed safe lighting for your child

See the [Installation Guide](docs/CHILD_NIGHT_LIGHT_INSTALLATION.md) for detailed setup instructions and configuration templates.

## Scientific Background

### Circadian Rhythm Lighting
Based on research into:
- Natural sunlight variation throughout the day (2000K-6600K)
- Blue light's effect on melatonin suppression and alertness
- Melanopsin photopigment response to different wavelengths
- Circadian rhythm optimization for sleep quality

Color temperatures and timing are designed to support your body's natural circadian cycle while providing appropriate lighting for daily activities.

### Child Night Light
Based on peer-reviewed pediatric sleep research:
- Hartstein et al. (2022) - High sensitivity of melatonin suppression in preschool children
- Lee et al. (2018) - Blue-enriched light effects in children vs. adults
- Akacem et al. (2022) - Light exposure timing and duration effects
- Multiple studies on amber/red wavelength safety for children's sleep

All defaults are set to research-backed safe levels for ages 1-5.

## Customization

All time ranges and settings can be customized:
- Adjust phase timings for night shift workers
- Modify color temperatures for personal preference
- Change motion timeout duration
- Set custom lux thresholds
- Enable/disable brightness adjustment
