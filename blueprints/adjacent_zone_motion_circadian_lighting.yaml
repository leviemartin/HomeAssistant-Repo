blueprint:
  name: Adjacent Zone Motion - Circadian Lighting v1.0
  description: >
    Motion-activated lighting for hallways, bathrooms, and stairs with EXACT color
    consistency to the Intelligent Living Room blueprint. Features lux-aware control,
    circadian rhythm, staged turn-off warnings, and zone-based timing presets.


    This blueprint is OPTIMIZED for adjacent zones like hallways, bathrooms, stairs,
    closets, and utility areas. It shares IDENTICAL circadian color logic with the
    living room blueprint to ensure seamless color consistency throughout your home.


    KEY FEATURES:


    - MOTION SENSOR INTEGRATION: Works with any PIR or mmWave motion sensor. Simple
      binary_sensor detection - no complex zone mapping required.


    - ZONE PRESET SYSTEM: Quick-select timing presets for common zones:
      * Very Quick (3/5/7 min) - Closets, Stairs
      * Quick (5/10/15 min) - Hallways, Bathrooms (DEFAULT)
      * Medium (10/15/20 min) - Utility, Garage
      * Custom - Configure your own timing


    - COLOR CONSISTENCY: EXACT same circadian sun elevation formula as living room.
      Seamless color matching when walking between rooms (1800K-5500K range).


    - LUX-AWARE HYSTERESIS: Hardcoded thresholds (150/80 lux) with debounce prevent
      flickering. Same anti-flicker system as living room for consistency.


    - DYNAMIC BRIGHTNESS: Brightness scales inversely with ambient lux using IDENTICAL
      curve as living room (50/75/100/125/150 lux breakpoints).


    - STAGED TURN-OFF: Progressive warnings before lights turn off. Dim to 40% with
      warm 1800K color, then 20%, then off. Same dimming behavior as living room.


    - MANUAL OVERRIDE: Button/switch/input_boolean support to keep lights on regardless
      of lux level. Perfect for cleaning or extended bathroom use.


    - SUNRISE/SUNSET SMART: Extended 10-minute debounce during dawn/dusk prevents
      oscillation from rapidly changing natural light.


    PERFECT FOR: Hallways, bathrooms, stairs, closets, laundry rooms, garages, any
    adjacent zone that should match your main room's color temperature.


    COMPATIBILITY: Works with any motion sensor, Philips Hue/IKEA Tradfri lights,
    and standard illuminance sensors.
