  name: Adjacent Zone Motion - Circadian Lighting v1.5
  description: >
    Motion-activated lighting for hallways, bathrooms, and stairs with EXACT color
    consistency to the Intelligent Living Room blueprint. Features lux-aware control,
    circadian rhythm, staged turn-off warnings, and configurable brightness controls.


    This is v1.5 - CRITICAL BUG FIX: Adds lux numeric_state trigger so lights turn
    off when room becomes bright (sunrise, curtains opened). v1.4 only checked lux at
    motion trigger time and never monitored it afterward
    period. Simplified turn-on logic for immediate response while maintaining all
    anti-flicker protection via simple threshold checks.


    This blueprint is OPTIMIZED for adjacent zones like hallways, bathrooms, stairs,
    closets, and utility areas. It shares IDENTICAL circadian color logic with the
    living room blueprint to ensure seamless color consistency throughout your home.


    KEY FEATURES:


    - MOTION SENSOR INTEGRATION: Works with any PIR or mmWave motion sensor. Simple
      binary_sensor detection - no complex zone mapping required. Compatible with
      Aqara, Philips Hue, and all standard motion sensors. v1.3 fixes PIR cooldown
      handling for reliable turn-off behavior.


    - SIMPLIFIED TIMING: Single preset optimized for hallways and bathrooms.
      Stage 1: 5 minutes (40% + 1800K warm)
      Stage 2: 10 minutes total (20% + 1800K warm)
      Stage 3: 15 minutes total (OFF)


    - COLOR CONSISTENCY: EXACT same circadian sun elevation formula as living room.
      Seamless color matching when walking between rooms (1800K-5500K range).


    - LUX-AWARE HYSTERESIS: Hardcoded thresholds (150/80 lux) prevent flickering.
      v1.4 uses simple condition checks instead of debounce waits for immediate
      turn-on response. Anti-flicker protection maintained via threshold separation.


    - CONFIGURABLE BRIGHTNESS: Fully adjustable brightness curve at 5 lux breakpoints
      (50/75/100/125/150 lux). Configure stage warning brightness (40%/20% defaults).
      Enable/disable dynamic brightness with toggle.


    - STAGED TURN-OFF: Progressive warnings before lights turn off. Configurable
      dimming to warm 1800K color. Fully customizable brightness percentages.


    - MANUAL OVERRIDE: Button/switch/input_boolean support to keep lights on regardless
      of lux level. Perfect for cleaning or extended bathroom use.


    - SUNRISE/SUNSET SMART: Extended 10-minute debounce during dawn/dusk prevents
      oscillation from rapidly changing natural light (applied only to turn-OFF).


    PERFECT FOR: Hallways, bathrooms, stairs, closets, laundry rooms, garages, any
    adjacent zone that should match your main room's color temperature.


    COMPATIBILITY: Works with any motion sensor, Philips Hue/IKEA Tradfri lights,
    and standard illuminance sensors.


    v1.4 CHANGELOG: CRITICAL FIX - Removed debounce wait on turn-ON (lines 543-546
    in v1.3) that was causing lights to fail to turn on when lux fluctuated during
    the 2-minute wait. Simplified to immediate turn-on with simple lux threshold
    check. Debounce is only needed for turn-OFF to prevent flicker, not turn-ON.

          # === STEP 2: WAIT FOR MOTION TO CLEAR (v1.3 PIR-COMPATIBLE APPROACH) ===
          # This is the CRITICAL FIX for PIR sensor compatibility.
          # Instead of a monitoring loop, we use wait_for_trigger with timeout.
          #
          # WHY THIS WORKS WITH PIR SENSORS:
          # - PIR goes "on" briefly when motion detected (trigger fires)
          # - PIR automatically goes "off" after 1-2 min cooldown
          # - We wait for stage_1_delay_sec (5 min) for ANY new motion
          # - If new motion detected during wait → automation RESTARTS (mode: restart)
          # - If wait completes (5 min with no motion) → proceed to turn-off
          #
          # This handles PIR cooldown correctly:
          # - Initial motion → trigger → lights on
          # - PIR goes "off" after 1 min (cooldown) → we ignore this
          # - We wait 5 min for NEW motion trigger
          # - If person still present → they'll trigger motion again → restart
          # - If person actually left → no new triggers → turn off

          - wait_for_trigger:
              - platform: state
                entity_id: !input motion_sensor
                to: "on"

              seconds: "{{ stage_1_delay_sec }}"  # 5 minutes
            continue_on_timeout: true

          # === STEP 3: CHECK IF MOTION DETECTED DURING WAIT ===
          # If wait.trigger is defined, motion was detected → automation will restart
          # via mode: restart, so this code won't execute.
          #
          # If we reach here, motion was NOT detected for 15 minutes.
