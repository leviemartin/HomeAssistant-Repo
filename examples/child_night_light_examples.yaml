# Child Night Light Blueprint - Example Configurations
#
# This file contains real-world example configurations for the Child-Friendly
# Night Light Automation blueprint. Copy and adapt these examples to match
# your specific needs.
#
# Each example includes:
# - Target age range
# - Use case scenario
# - Complete configuration
# - Expected behavior
# - Rationale for settings

# ==============================================================================
# EXAMPLE 1: Basic Nursery Night Light (Ages 0-12 months)
# ==============================================================================
#
# Use Case:
#   Simple night light for infant nursery. Very low brightness to protect
#   infant's highly sensitive circadian rhythm. No motion sensor to avoid
#   disturbances from normal infant movement.
#
# Configuration:
alias: "Nursery Night Light - Basic Infant"
description: Ultra-low brightness amber night light for newborn/infant
use_blueprint:
  path: child_night_light.yaml
  input:
    # Lights
    target_lights:
      entity_id: light.nursery_lamp

    # Brightness & Color
    base_brightness: 2  # Ultra-low for infant sensitivity
    color_temperature: 2000  # Warm amber

    # Nighttime Schedule
    nighttime_enabled: true
    nighttime_start: "18:30:00"  # 6:30 PM bedtime
    nighttime_end: "06:30:00"    # 6:30 AM wake time

    # Nap Schedules (adjust to your infant's schedule)
    nap1_enabled: true
    nap1_start: "09:00:00"  # Morning nap
    nap1_end: "11:00:00"

    nap2_enabled: true
    nap2_start: "13:00:00"  # Afternoon nap
    nap2_end: "15:00:00"

    # No motion sensor (avoid triggering from normal infant movement)
    motion_sensor: {}

    # Gentle transitions
    transition_duration: 5
#
# Expected Behavior:
#   - Lights turn on automatically at 6:30 PM with barely visible amber glow
#   - Same lighting during both nap times
#   - Lights turn off at 6:30 AM
#   - No motion-based changes
#
# Rationale:
#   - 2% brightness is lowest safe level, protecting infant melatonin
#   - 2000K provides minimal circadian disruption (research-backed)
#   - No motion sensor prevents false triggers from sleeping baby
#   - Two nap periods typical for this age range

# ==============================================================================
# EXAMPLE 2: Nursery with Motion Sensor for Parent Checks (Ages 0-18 months)
# ==============================================================================
#
# Use Case:
#   Nursery night light that's normally very dim but increases brightness when
#   parent enters to check on baby, change diaper, or feed. Motion sensor
#   positioned to only detect adult movement, not baby in crib.
#
# Configuration:
alias: "Nursery Night Light - Motion Assisted"
description: Low brightness with motion boost for parent nighttime checks
use_blueprint:
  path: child_night_light.yaml
  input:
    # Lights (multiple for better coverage)
    target_lights:
      entity_id:
        - light.nursery_ceiling
        - light.nursery_lamp

    # Brightness & Color
    base_brightness: 2  # Very low baseline
    color_temperature: 2000  # Warm amber

    # Nighttime Schedule
    nighttime_enabled: true
    nighttime_start: "19:00:00"  # 7:00 PM
    nighttime_end: "07:00:00"    # 7:00 AM

    # Nap Schedules
    nap1_enabled: true
    nap1_start: "09:30:00"
    nap1_end: "11:00:00"

    nap2_enabled: true
    nap2_start: "13:30:00"
    nap2_end: "15:30:00"

    # Motion Sensor Settings
    motion_sensor: binary_sensor.nursery_motion
    motion_brightness_boost: 12  # Enough to see clearly for diaper changes
    motion_boost_duration: 90    # 90 seconds for typical parent check

    # Smooth transitions
    transition_duration: 4
#
# Expected Behavior:
#   - Normal state: Very dim amber glow (2%)
#   - When parent enters: Brightness increases to 12% (still dim, but functional)
#   - After 90 seconds of no motion: Returns to 2%
#   - Color remains warm amber throughout
#
# Rationale:
#   - Base 2% doesn't disturb sleeping baby
#   - 12% boost provides functional light for diaper changes/feeding
#   - 90 second duration covers typical check-in time
#   - Motion sensor must be positioned to avoid triggering from crib movement
#
# Motion Sensor Placement Tips:
#   - Mount sensor aiming at doorway/entrance
#   - Angle away from crib to avoid detecting baby movement
#   - Test positioning during day to ensure it only triggers when adult enters

# ==============================================================================
# EXAMPLE 3: Toddler Bedroom with Bathroom Path (Ages 2-4 years)
# ==============================================================================
#
# Use Case:
#   Recently potty-trained toddler needs safe pathway from bedroom to bathroom.
#   Multiple lights create a lighted path. Motion sensor in hallway triggers
#   brightness boost for safe navigation.
#
# Configuration:
alias: "Toddler Bedroom & Bathroom Path"
description: Multi-room night lighting with motion-triggered pathway
use_blueprint:
  path: child_night_light.yaml
  input:
    # Multiple lights along path
    target_lights:
      entity_id:
        - light.bedroom_night_light
        - light.hallway_light
        - light.bathroom_vanity

    # Brightness & Color
    base_brightness: 3  # Safe low level
    color_temperature: 2000  # Warm amber

    # Nighttime Only (no naps at this age)
    nighttime_enabled: true
    nighttime_start: "19:30:00"  # 7:30 PM bedtime
    nighttime_end: "07:00:00"    # 7:00 AM wake time

    # Naps disabled
    nap1_enabled: false
    nap2_enabled: false

    # Motion Sensor Settings
    motion_sensor: binary_sensor.hallway_motion
    motion_brightness_boost: 15  # Higher for safe walking
    motion_boost_duration: 120   # 2 minutes for bathroom trip

    # Smooth transitions
    transition_duration: 4
#
# Expected Behavior:
#   - All lights (bedroom, hallway, bathroom) glow dimly at 3% from 7:30 PM
#   - When toddler gets up: Hallway motion sensor detects movement
#   - All lights brighten to 15% for safe navigation
#   - After bathroom trip (2 minutes no motion): Return to 3%
#   - Lights turn off at 7:00 AM wake time
#
# Rationale:
#   - 3% base provides enough light to safely navigate when boosted
#   - 15% boost is bright enough for safe walking but won't fully wake child
#   - 2 minute duration covers typical bathroom trip
#   - All lights on same automation ensures consistent path lighting
#
# Alternative Approach:
#   You could create TWO separate automations:
#   - Bedroom light: 2% base, 8% boost (very low)
#   - Hallway/bathroom: 5% base, 20% boost (brighter for safety)

# ==============================================================================
# EXAMPLE 4: Preschooler Transitioning from Night Light (Ages 4-5 years)
# ==============================================================================
#
# Use Case:
#   Child is ready to learn sleeping without night light, but still needs
#   comfort/safety. This configuration gradually reduces dependency by only
#   keeping light on for first part of night and having motion-only backup.
#
# Configuration:
alias: "Preschooler - Gradual Night Light Reduction"
description: Light turns off mid-night to encourage darkness tolerance
use_blueprint:
  path: child_night_light.yaml
  input:
    # Single small light
    target_lights:
      entity_id: light.bedroom_small_lamp

    # Lower brightness (child is older, less sensitive)
    base_brightness: 4
    color_temperature: 2200  # Slightly less strict than younger ages

    # Nighttime - ENDS AT MIDNIGHT (turns off mid-sleep)
    nighttime_enabled: true
    nighttime_start: "20:00:00"  # 8:00 PM bedtime
    nighttime_end: "00:00:00"    # Midnight (light turns off)

    # No naps
    nap1_enabled: false
    nap2_enabled: false

    # Motion sensor provides backup if child wakes
    motion_sensor: binary_sensor.bedroom_motion
    motion_brightness_boost: 10
    motion_boost_duration: 60

    # Gentle transitions
    transition_duration: 5
#
# Expected Behavior:
#   - Light turns on at 8 PM bedtime with gentle amber glow
#   - Child falls asleep with comforting light
#   - At midnight, light turns off (child already asleep, won't notice)
#   - If child wakes after midnight and moves, light briefly activates
#   - Gradually teaches tolerance of sleeping in darkness
#
# Rationale:
#   - Light during falling-asleep period provides comfort
#   - Turning off at midnight means child sleeps most of night in darkness
#   - Motion sensor provides safety backup if actually needed
#   - Prepares child for full darkness sleeping
#
# Gradual Reduction Schedule (over 8-12 weeks):
#   Week 1-2: End time 00:00 (midnight)
#   Week 3-4: End time 23:00 (11 PM)
#   Week 5-6: End time 22:00 (10 PM)
#   Week 7-8: End time 21:00 (9 PM - 1 hour after bedtime)
#   Week 9+: Disable scheduled activation, motion-only

# ==============================================================================
# EXAMPLE 5: Multiple Children Sharing Room (Ages 2-5 years)
# ==============================================================================
#
# Use Case:
#   Siblings with different bedtimes sharing a room. Automation must handle
#   overlapping schedules without turning lights off between bedtimes.
#
# Configuration:
alias: "Shared Bedroom - Staggered Bedtimes"
description: Night light for room with two children, different schedules
use_blueprint:
  path: child_night_light.yaml
  input:
    # Room lighting
    target_lights:
      entity_id:
        - light.shared_bedroom_lamp_1
        - light.shared_bedroom_lamp_2

    # Brightness & Color
    base_brightness: 3
    color_temperature: 2000

    # Nighttime - EARLIEST bedtime to LATEST wake time
    nighttime_enabled: true
    nighttime_start: "19:00:00"  # When first child goes to bed
    nighttime_end: "07:30:00"    # When last child wakes up

    # Nap - Overlapping nap times
    nap1_enabled: true
    nap1_start: "13:00:00"  # When first child naps
    nap1_end: "15:30:00"    # When last child finishes nap

    nap2_enabled: false  # Only one nap at these ages

    # Motion sensor for any child's movement
    motion_sensor: binary_sensor.shared_bedroom_motion
    motion_brightness_boost: 12
    motion_boost_duration: 90

    # Gentle transitions (very important in shared room)
    transition_duration: 6  # Extra gentle to not disturb either child
#
# Expected Behavior:
#   - Lights turn on at 7 PM when first child goes to bed
#   - Lights stay on continuously through both bedtimes
#   - Lights remain on until 7:30 AM (after both children awake)
#   - Motion triggers boost if either child gets up
#
# Rationale:
#   - Single automation simpler than coordinating multiple
#   - Covers full time window when ANY child needs night light
#   - Extra gentle transitions important when one child already sleeping
#
# Alternative: Different Light Zones
#   If children have separate areas of room:
#   - Create two automations (one per child/light)
#   - Each child's light on their specific schedule
#   - Allows customization per child's needs

# ==============================================================================
# EXAMPLE 6: Summer vs Winter Schedule Adjustment
# ==============================================================================
#
# Use Case:
#   Bedtime shifts with seasons (later in summer, earlier in winter due to
#   natural light patterns). This example shows TWO automations you can
#   toggle between seasons.
#
# SUMMER SCHEDULE:
alias: "Child Night Light - Summer Schedule"
description: Later bedtime for summer months (June-August)
use_blueprint:
  path: child_night_light.yaml

    # SUMMER: Later bedtime due to daylight
    nighttime_enabled: true
    nighttime_start: "20:30:00"  # 8:30 PM (still light outside)
    nighttime_end: "07:30:00"    # 7:30 AM (sleeping in a bit)

    nap1_enabled: true
    nap1_start: "14:00:00"  # Later nap
    nap1_end: "16:00:00"

    nap2_enabled: false

    motion_sensor: binary_sensor.bedroom_motion
    motion_brightness_boost: 10
    motion_boost_duration: 60

    transition_duration: 4
#
# WINTER SCHEDULE:
alias: "Child Night Light - Winter Schedule"
description: Earlier bedtime for winter months (November-February)
use_blueprint:
  path: child_night_light.yaml
  input:
    target_lights:
      entity_id: light.bedroom_lamp

    base_brightness: 3
    color_temperature: 2000

    # WINTER: Earlier bedtime due to darkness
    nighttime_enabled: true
    nighttime_start: "18:30:00"  # 6:30 PM (dark outside)
    nighttime_end: "07:00:00"    # 7:00 AM (typical wake time)

    nap1_enabled: true
    nap1_start: "13:00:00"  # Standard nap time
    nap1_end: "15:00:00"

    nap2_enabled: false

    motion_sensor: binary_sensor.bedroom_motion
    motion_brightness_boost: 10
    motion_boost_duration: 60

    transition_duration: 4
#
# Usage:
#   - Create both automations
#   - Manually disable the off-season automation
#   - Enable the current season automation
#   - Toggle twice per year (or use automation to toggle automations!)
#
# Advanced: Automatic Seasonal Switching
#   You could create a separate automation that:
#   - Triggers on specific dates (June 1, November 1)
#   - Disables one automation and enables the other
#   - Requires automation.turn_on and automation.turn_off services

# EXAMPLE 7: Ultra-Sensitive Sleeper (Any Age)
# ==============================================================================
#
# Use Case:
#   Child who is extremely sensitive to any light or changes. Needs absolute
#   minimum brightness, gentlest transitions, and no motion triggers that might
#   disturb sleep.
#
# Configuration:
alias: "Night Light - Ultra Sensitive Sleeper"
description: Minimum brightness, no motion triggers, maximum gentleness
use_blueprint:

      entity_id: light.corner_lamp

    # Absolute minimum settings
    base_brightness: 1  # Lowest possible
    color_temperature: 1700  # Warmest possible (match flame)

    # Standard schedule
    nighttime_enabled: true

    nighttime_end: "07:00:00"

    # Naps as needed
    nap1_enabled: true
    nap1_start: "13:00:00"
    nap1_end: "15:00:00"

    nap2_enabled: false

    # NO motion sensor (avoid any changes during sleep)
    motion_sensor: {}

    # Maximum gentleness
    transition_duration: 10  # Very slow, imperceptible changes
#
# Expected Behavior:
#   - Barely visible warm glow (like distant candle)
#   - Absolutely no changes during sleep period
#   - Ultra-slow fade-in and fade-out
#   - Minimal circadian impact
#
# Rationale:
#   - 1% brightness is absolute minimum most lights support
#   - 1700K is warmest available (candlelight spectrum)
#   - No motion sensor prevents any disturbance
#   - 10 second transitions are imperceptible
#
# Additional Recommendations:
#   - Use smallest wattage smart bulb available
#   - Position lamp facing wall/corner (indirect light)
#   - Use lampshade to further diffuse
#   - Consider gradual elimination of light over time

# ==============================================================================
# EXAMPLE 8: Different Settings for Different Rooms
# ==============================================================================
#
# Use Case:
#   Want different brightness/behavior for bedroom vs. bathroom vs. hallway.
#   This shows THREE separate automations for one child's sleep environment.
#
# BEDROOM - Very Low:

# BATHROOM - Highest:
alias: "Night Light - Bathroom (Functional)"
description: Functional bathroom lighting for nighttime use
use_blueprint:
  path: child_night_light.yaml
  input:
    target_lights:
      entity_id: light.bathroom_vanity

    base_brightness: 8  # Higher base for functionality

    nap2_enabled: false

    # Motion triggers BATHROOM brightness boost
    motion_sensor: binary_sensor.bathroom_motion
    motion_brightness_boost: 25  # High enough to be functional
    motion_boost_duration: 120  # Longer for bathroom tasks

    transition_duration: 2
#
# Expected Behavior:
#   - Bedroom: Very dim (2%), protects sleep
#   - Hallway: Dim (5%), provides safe path
#   - Bathroom: Functional (8%), allows use
#   - Each room has appropriate motion boost
#
# Rationale:
#   - Different rooms have different needs
#   - Bedroom prioritizes sleep protection
#   - Hallway prioritizes navigation safety
#   - Bathroom prioritizes functionality
#   - All maintain warm amber color for circadian protection

# ==============================================================================
# NOTES AND TIPS
# ==============================================================================
#
# General Configuration Tips:
#
# 1. START CONSERVATIVE:
#    Begin with very low brightness (2-3%) and increase if needed.
#    It's safer to start too dim than too bright.
#
# 2. TEST DURING DAY:
#    Trigger automation manually during daytime to verify:
#    - Color temperature looks correct (warm amber)
#    - Brightness is appropriate
#    - Motion sensors work properly
#    - Transitions are smooth
#
# 3. MONITOR SLEEP QUALITY:
#    Watch for 3-5 days after configuration:
#    - Is child falling asleep easily?
#    - Sleeping through night?
#    - Waking refreshed?
#    Adjust if sleep quality decreases.
#
# 4. GRADUAL CHANGES:
#    If adjusting settings, change ONE thing at a time:
#    - Week 1: Reduce brightness by 1%
#    - Week 2: Observe
#    - Week 3: Reduce another 1% if successful
#
# 5. AGE PROGRESSION:
#    As child grows, gradually:
#    - Reduce brightness
#    - Shorten duration (turn off mid-night)
#    - Eventually eliminate if possible
#
# Motion Sensor Tips:
#
# 1. POSITIONING:
#    - Nursery: Aim at doorway, away from crib
#    - Bedroom: Aim at bed exit point
#    - Hallway: Aim at walking path
#    - Bathroom: Aim at entrance
#
# 2. SENSITIVITY:
#    - Too sensitive: Triggers from sleeping movement
#    - Too low: Doesn't trigger when needed
#    - Adjust sensor settings if available
#
# 3. HEIGHT:
#    - Mount at child's standing height
#    - Too high: Won't detect toddler
#    - Too low: Triggers from pets
#
# Light Selection Tips:
#
# 1. BULB CHOICE:
#    - Philips Hue: Excellent color range, reliable
#    - IKEA TRADFRI: Budget-friendly, good performance
#    - Generic brands: Test color temperature support
#
# 2. BRIGHTNESS CAPABILITY:
#    - Ensure bulb can dim to 1-3% (not all can)
#    - Test minimum brightness before relying on it
#    - Lower wattage bulbs generally dim better
#
# 3. POSITIONING:
#    - Face lamp away from bed (indirect light)
#    - Use corner or low placement
#    - Consider under-bed or baseboard placement
#    - Add lampshades to diffuse
#
# Color Temperature Notes:
#
# - 1700K = Candlelight (warmest)
# - 2000K = Firelight (recommended default)
# - 2200K = Early sunrise (still very safe)
# - 2700K = Warm white (maximum for children)
# - 3000K+ = NOT recommended for sleep
#
# If your bulb can't reach 2000K:
# - Use lowest available (2700K minimum)
# - Reduce brightness even further
# - Consider different bulb brand
#
# Common Mistakes to Avoid:
#
# 1. ❌ Too bright "just to be safe"
#    ✅ Start very dim, increase only if needed
#
# 2. ❌ Using cool white or blue-tinted light
#    ✅ Always use warm amber (≤2700K)
#
# 3. ❌ Pointing light directly at child's bed
#    ✅ Use indirect lighting (face wall/corner)
#
# 4. ❌ Very fast transitions
#    ✅ Use 3-5+ second gentle fades
#
# 5. ❌ Same brightness for all ages
#    ✅ Adjust for child's age and sensitivity
#
# 6. ❌ Never adjusting as child grows
#    ✅ Gradually reduce dependence over time
#
# 7. ❌ Ignoring child's individual response
#    ✅ Customize based on your specific child's needs
